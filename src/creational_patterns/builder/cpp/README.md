# Builder pattern in C++

In this example, the CarBuilder class is responsible for building Car objects. 
The CarBuilder class has setter methods for each of the properties of the Car class. 
The setter methods return a reference to the CarBuilder object, allowing for method chaining. 
The build method returns the final Car object, which can be constructed using the properties set through the setter methods. 
In main, a CarBuilder object is created, and its setter methods are called to set the properties of the car. 
Finally, the build method is called to construct and return the Car object.
