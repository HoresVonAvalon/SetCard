# Builder Pattern in C#

The code demonstrates an implementaion of the builder design pattern in C#.

The builder pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to create complex objects by using a step-by-step approach, 
rather than creating the object all at once in a single constructor call.

The example defines a Person class with various properties such as name, age, and address. 
The PersonBuilder class is the builder class that helps in creating Person objects by providing methods to set each property. 
The Person class has a private constructor, making it only accessible through the builder class.

In the main method, we create an instance of the PersonBuilder class and call the various methods on it to set the properties of the Person object. 
Finally, we call the Build method on the builder class, which creates and returns the Person object.

This example shows how the builder pattern can be used to create complex objects in a more organized and readable manner, 
making it easier to maintain and extend in the future.
