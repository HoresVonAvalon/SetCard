# Abstract factroy in PHP

The code defines an interface called AbstractFactory which acts as the parent for all concrete factory classes. 
This interface defines two methods: createRectangle() and createSquare().

The RectangleFactory and SquareFactory classes implement the AbstractFactory interface. 
These two classes are responsible for creating objects of the Rectangle and Square classes respectively.

The Rectangle and Square classes define the properties and behavior of the rectangles and squares that the factories will create.

The Client class is the class that uses the abstract factory to create shapes. 
It takes an instance of the AbstractFactory interface as an argument and then uses it to create instances of rectangles or squares.

In the Client class, the createShapes() method is used to create instances of the shapes. 
It takes an instance of the AbstractFactory interface and then uses it to create instances of either rectangles or squares. 
The type of shape created depends on the concrete factory that is passed to the method.

Finally, the main() function is used to demonstrate the use of the abstract factory. 
It creates an instance of the RectangleFactory and then uses it to create a rectangle. 
It then creates an instance of the SquareFactory and uses it to create a square.In this code, 
the abstract factory is defined by the AbstractFactory class, which has two abstract methods: getShape and getColor. 
These methods will be implemented by concrete factory classes, ShapeFactory and ColorFactory, to return the specific shape or color objects.

The FactoryProducer class is used to get an instance of the specific factory based on the user's choice. 
The returned factory instance can then be used to get the desired shape or color object.# Abstract factory in PHP
